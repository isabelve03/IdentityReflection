    <h3>My Story</h3>
    <p>I was always a creative child at heart. I constantly spent hours drawing and sketching the environment around me.</p>
    <p>I played a lot of instruments since I was young: Violin, piano, ukelele, and both acoustic and electric guitar.</p>
    <p>Writing also allowed me to build the imaginative worlds to word and further express myself.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Starting young, I have always loved video games.</p>
    <p>I found that games combined all of my hobbies into one and wanted to create experiences for others.</p>
    <p>Currently, I am pursuing a bachelor's in Computer Science with an emphasis in game development.</p>
    <p>Eevery academic projeect is an opportunity to mergee coding with my creativity.</p>
    <br> 
    <p>Games are an art in themselves, similar to the expression of film, video games gives a deeper personal connection to the character one plays as.</p> 
    <p>In my career, I plan to create experiences and connect others to as a community similar to what I had growing up.</p>

    <p>Video games has always been a source of both community and solace by immersing myself into these different characters, worlds, and storylines.</p>
